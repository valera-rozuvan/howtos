# Set proper time zone on a Debian-based Linux distro

This is working on Ubuntu 24.10. Also, this should work on a recent Debian based distro.

First, make sure you are getting automatic date and time updates via NTP:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd.service
sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd.service
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```

Second, set your preferred time zone. For example, for New York (USA):

```shell
sudo timedatectl set-timezone "America/New_York"
```
