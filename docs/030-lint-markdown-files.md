# lint Markdown files

Install the awesome utility [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint):

```shell
sudo apt install markdownlint
```

Your system now should have a binary called `mdl`. Use it on a file:

```shell
mdl /path/to/some/markdown-file.md
```

The `mdl` tool will report any linting errors to the `stdout`. For example,

```text
/path/to/some/markdown-file.md:34: MD013 Line length
/path/to/some/markdown-file.md:30: MD029 Ordered list item prefix
/path/to/some/markdown-file.md:32: MD029 Ordered list item prefix
```

If you want to turn off some linting rules, run:

```shell
mdl -r "~MD013,~MD029" /path/to/some/markdown-file.md
```

Now the `mdl` tool will lint the file, but not trigger warnings for the rules `MD013` and `MD029`.
